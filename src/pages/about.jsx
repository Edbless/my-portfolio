        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is <strong>Gifty Hemans</strong> â€” a dedicated and forward-thinking Computer Science student, a die hard Chelsea fan with an unshakable passion for technology, innovation, and impact. I am driven not only by a love for writing clean and efficient code, but by the deeper desire to solve real-world problems and create meaningful digital experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years, Iâ€™ve cultivated a diverse skill set across web development, software engineering, cybersecurity awareness, and data analytics. My journey began with curiosity â€” tinkering, learning, and exploring how systems work under the hood â€” and has evolved into a mission: to build solutions that uplift, empower, and protect.
        </p>

        <p>
          Iâ€™ve become fluent in technologies like <strong>Angular</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, and <strong>Python</strong>. Iâ€™m equally comfortable designing intuitive interfaces as I am engineering robust back-end logic. I believe that great software is not just about functionality â€” itâ€™s about user trust, accessibility, and elegance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Beyond my technical skills, Iâ€™m a firm believer in lifelong learning, collaboration, and servant leadership. I actively seek opportunities to contribute to community-driven tech, and Iâ€™m passionate about raising awareness around cybersecurity in a world where digital threats are growing daily.
        </p>

        <p>
          My long-term goal? To establish a firm that not only provides job opportunities, but becomes a catalyst for community growth â€” a space where innovation meets impact, and where technology bridges gaps rather than widens them.
        </p>

        <p>
          This portfolio represents more than just what Iâ€™ve done â€” it reflects who I am, what I value, and where Iâ€™m headed. I invite you to explore it, and if youâ€™re someone who believes in the power of vision-driven technology, letâ€™s connect.
